# Project3_SkincareFinder
The Skincare Finder is a machine that analyzes the moisture level of the skin and recommends skincare products based on skin types and concerns. The user will get to learn more about what it means to have dry, normal, or oily skin. They will be given a product recommendation based on their skin type and the selected “skin goal”.
